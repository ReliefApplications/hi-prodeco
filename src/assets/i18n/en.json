Zouleikha's uncle was a minesweeper. He unfortunately succumbed to a mine accident which gave birth to his vocation. She started working with the HCND in 2009, as secretary to the Mine Victim Assistance Directorate and as the Community Liaison Group Leader. In 2011, thanks to an American NGO, she was able to take her EOD1 in Chad.\nShe left the HCND in 2016 to work with Humanity and Inclusion as a community liaison officer in the lake region. From 2017, Zouleikha was hired by MAG as a deminer and thanks to the PRODECO project funded by the European Union, she was able to pass her EOD2 and EOD 3 qualifications in Benin in 2018 and 2019.\nSince mine clearance is a predominantly male environment, this choice of life has given her various reactions that she was able to overcome thanks to the support of her mother. On the whole, her family support her although some have been surprised by her choice. However, it was difficult for other deminers to accept a woman on their team. Some considered a woman's place to be at home, not on a minefield; but Zouleikha, the only girl in a family of 9 boys, already used to working in a predominantly male environment, discussed a lot with her colleagues to make them accept the idea of ​​having a woman on their team. Now she explains that she no longer gets tired of arguing with people who see the role of women as staying at home and prefers to focus on those who accept the discussion. To Chadian women, Zouleikha wishes to remind that their place is not only at home but that they must be daring. She also testifies to seeing things start to evolve even if the customs are sometimes cumbersome. One of his neighbors, enthusiastic about his example, decided to push his daughter to engage in fields usually reserved for men, which is a source of pride for Zouleikha."
